# deep-learning

Exercise projects on basic deep learning algorithms

## ex1_Python Basics with Numpy

- Be able to use iPython Notebooks
- Be able to use numpy functions and numpy matrix/vector operations
- Understand the concept of "broadcasting"
- Be able to vectorize code


## ex2_Logistic Regression as a Neural Network

- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
  - Initializing parameters
  - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
  - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
